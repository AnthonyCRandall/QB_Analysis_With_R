# üèà 2023 QB Analysis

This personal project dives into quarterback passing statistics for the 2023 NFL season. The data was extracted from **Pro Football Focus** and transformed into clean, visualized insight. The purpose of this project is to showcase my data science and R programming skills through every stage of the process.

### Overview

Inside this repository are three scripts that tackle the process of transforming NFL QB stats into easy to read visualizations:

1. **Web Scraping**: Using the library `rvest`, I was able to grab the 2023 passing data from Pro Football Focus.
2. **Data Cleaning**: At this stage, it was time to clean, organize, and prepared the data for analysis and visualization.
3. **Visualization**: Finally, the stats were brought to life through ggplot2.

### üß∞ Tools
- **R**
  - `rvest` for web scraping.
  - `dplr` and `tidyr` for cleaning, transforming, standardizing, and filtering data.
  - `ggplot2` for those beautiful pictures ;).
- **RStudio** as my IDE of choice.
- **GitHub** to obviously display the work.

 ### üí≠ Why did I do this?

As someone who loves data science (and of course is a football enthusiast), I wanted to combine my passions for analytics and professional sports into one project. This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Scrape real-life data off of the internet.
- Digest and clean messy data.
- Use visualization to paint my findings.
